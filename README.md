# CNNandDogs
a simple Convolutional Neural Network to predict whether an image is a cat or a dog

# Description
Made this over a year ago, progress from the same course as
ANN-Bank-Solutions. (I think) it works??? 

Basically uses some of the newer concepts like max pooling and convolutional 
layers to train the weights against the images. somewhat the same concept 
as a normal ANN after the image preprocessing to train the NN. 

I scribbled somewhere that it had a 85% training accuracy and 74% testing set 
accuracy. Ill take my word for it.

Help is always appreciated. Always trying to learn!
